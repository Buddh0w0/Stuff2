I wonder what the implications of treating your diary as a real person are. This is just a random thought I came across today. Most people begin their diary entries with something like "Dear diary", and many even go as far as naming their diaries and writing entries as if they were writing a letter to a friend. To me, this seems disturbing if anything. Why would you create a person whose sole purpose was to  hear your thoughts and say nothing in return? The idea of a friend with whom you share every little detail of your day to day life, and yet never expect a reply from is quite unsettling to me. It's depressing. I believe treating your diary like a friend is inherently egocentric. It's like treating your diary like a slave who exist only to hear you vent out your frustrations and depression and dissapointments and what not. But I digress.

Today I woke up with both my nostrils clear for a change. The anti-allergy medication seems to be working wonders, and since it got rid of my splitting headache, I was finally able to get some work done. After all, someone has to go through those heaps of files lying on my desk. As for anything new today, I found a penny in my drawer with Lincoln facing left instead of right. It might be worth something if I went to pawn it, but I decided to hold on to it. For now at least. Apart from that, nothing new. The weather has been quite pleasant these days.

I'm writing this entry a bit late today. We finally got a lead on the Miller case, and I have been working non-stop day and night. As excited as I am, it certainly is taking a toll on my body and mind. I need to take some rest. I'm losing track of time. Like seriously, how is it past 12 AM already? I swear there is some sort of sorcery going on here. Also, I found a photo album of my childhood pictures in my bookshelf beneath a heap of files. How did that get there? I thought I had lost it a long time ago. I really need to take some rest now. I can barely keep my eyes open.

I remember it. I remember it all now. I can't write any of this down. It'd be too much of a risk. It's like a terrible joke. A punchline to some horrible godless comedy, and all I can do is laugh. If only I could live in this bliss of ignorance just a little while longer. Oh well, I deserve this, don't I? The blood on my hands is simply too much to overlook. This is it. This is how it ends.
