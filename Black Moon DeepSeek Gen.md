**Chapter 4: The Unseen Compulsion**

Vergil stared at his phone, the words "Sweet dreams" lingering like a threat. He tossed the device onto his bed, where Ichiyoru pawed at it curiously. "Salva Hills…" The name alone made his skin prickle. But Namami’s involvement gnawed at him. Since when did she agree to anything beyond her phone screen?

He opened his closet, eyeing the old hiking backpack buried under winter coats. Dadi’s phone, still lifeless, sat on his desk. On impulse, he slipped it into the bag. Maybe the cold will jolt it awake, he thought bitterly.

Ichiyoru mewed, her golden eyes reflecting the dim balcony light. Vergil scooped her up, pressing his forehead to hers. "Stay out of trouble," he murmured. The cat blinked slowly, as if in warning.

**Chapter 5: The Road to Salva Hills**

Christmas Eve dawned brittle and gray. Vergil stood at the bus stop, hoodie pulled tight against the wind. Allahrakha’s van rolled up, its windows fogged with condensation. Inside, Namami sat hunched in the backseat, her face lit by her phone’s glow. Felix lounged beside her, smirking.

"Took you long enough," Felix said, tossing Vergil a thermos. "Hot chocolate. Wouldn’t want you freezing before we get there."

Vergil ignored him, sliding into the passenger seat. Allahrakha grinned, his teeth too white. "Glad you made it, bro. You’re gonna love this."

The drive twisted through skeletal forests, the sky darkening prematurely. Vergil’s fingers brushed Dadi’s phone in his pocket. It felt… warmer.

**Chapter 6: The First Night**

Salva Hills was a ghost town swallowed by snowdrifts. The group rented a cabin on the outskirts, its wooden beams creaking under the weight of winter. Vergil’s nightmares seeped into reality: the same blinding blizzard, the same howling wind.

At midnight, Namami vanished.

They found her standing barefoot in the snow, halfway up the hill behind the cabin. Her breath fogged the air as she murmured, "He’s waiting."

"Who’s waiting?" Felix demanded, but Allahrakha silenced him with a raised hand.

"Let her go," he said, his voice unnervingly calm. "She’s just… connecting."

Vergil’s phone buzzed. A notification from Dadi’s number—impossible, it hadn’t worked in years. The screen flickered:

12:07 AM
Unknown Sender: Turn back.

**Chapter 7: The Black Moon Rises**

The storm hit at dawn. Snow piled against the cabin doors, sealing them inside. Felix paced, ranting about "wasted time," while Allahrakha sketched symbols on the frost-edged windows. Namami sat motionless, her phone dark for the first time.

Vergil retreated to the attic, Dadi’s phone glowing faintly in his palm. Static hissed from its speaker, resolving into a voice—his voice, warped and desperate: "The blade… find the blade."

Below, a scream tore through the silence.

Felix stood in the living room, pointing at the fireplace. The flames burned black, and within them, a silhouette emerged—tall, clawed, its eyes twin voids. Allahrakha laughed, low and guttural. "Right on time."

Namami rose, her pupils swallowed by silver. "The Black Moon hungers," she intoned. "He comes for the dreamer."

Vergil’s backpack vibrated. He unzipped it, and the old phone’s screen blazed to life, projecting a map into the air—a pulsing red dot deep in the valley. The same valley from his dreams.

Outside, the blizzard parted. A single path cut through the snow, leading into the heart of the storm.

**Chapter 8: The Path Through the Storm**

The cabin door burst open, snow swirling into the room like ash. Vergil gripped Dadi’s phone, its holographic map trembling in the air. The red dot pulsed rhythmically, as if echoing a heartbeat.

“We’re not staying here,” Vergil muttered, shoving past Allahrakha.

Felix grabbed his arm. “Are you insane? That thing out there—”

“Is here because of him,” Vergil snapped, jerking his chin toward Allahrakha. The transfer student leaned against the wall, his smirk sharpening.

“You’re smarter than you look,” Allahrakha said. “But the Moon’s already rising. You’ll need me to survive the valley.”

Namami stood in the doorway, her silvered eyes fixed on the path. “He waits,” she whispered. “The Keeper of the Blade.”

**Chapter 9: The Valley of Echoes**

The group trudged through the storm, snow crunching beneath their boots. The path narrowed, walls of ice rising on either side. Vergil’s breath came in ragged gasps, each exhale crystallizing into faint whispers. His whispers—fragments of his nightmares.

“Cold… too cold…”

“Find it… before He does…”

Felix stumbled, cursing. “Did you hear that? It’s like… voices in the wind.”

Allahrakha chuckled. “The valley remembers everything. Even your secrets, Felix.”

The air thickened. Shadows flitted at the edges of their vision—silhouettes of figures long buried in the snow.

**Chapter 10: The Shrine of the Blade**

The path ended at a cavernous ice shrine, its entrance carved with runes that glowed faintly blue. Inside, a pedestal stood at the center, holding a sword wreathed in black flame. The blade from Vergil’s dreams.

Namami fell to her knees, blood trickling from her nose. “He’s here.”

The temperature plummeted. The storm outside died abruptly, replaced by a deafening silence. Then—a crack, as the ice behind the pedestal split open.

A towering figure emerged, its body a shifting mass of frost and shadow. Hollow eyes locked onto Vergil.

“Dreamer,” it intoned, voice like glaciers grinding. “You carry the blood of the Gatekeeper.”

Allahrakha stepped forward, his charm dissolving into fervor. “Give me the blade, Vergil. It’s the only way to control Him!”

Vergil’s hand hovered over the sword. The flames didn’t burn—they hummed, resonating with the phone in his pocket. Dadi’s voice suddenly crackled from the device, clear and urgent: “Take it. It’s yours by right.”

**Chapter 11: The Black Moon’s Gaze**

Vergil seized the blade. Black fire erupted, engulfing the shrine. The entity roared, lurching forward, but the flames formed a barrier.

“You think a toy sword can stop me?” Allahrakha snarled, his skin cracking to reveal veins of ice.

“No,” Vergil said, raising the blade. “But this can.”

The phone’s screen shattered, releasing a surge of light. The holographic map reconfigured into a glowing sigil—the same mark on Vergil’s wrist, hidden beneath his sleeve.

The entity froze. “The Gatekeeper’s heir…”

Outside, the Black Moon breached the clouds, its dark light casting the valley into monochrome. The sigil on Vergil’s wrist burned gold, and the blade’s flames turned white-hot.

“Stay back!” Felix shouted, but Vergil was already moving.

The blade arced through the air—and struck nothing. The entity dissolved into mist, its final scream echoing: “This is not over.”

**Chapter 12: Aftermath**

The valley fell still. The storm vanished, leaving only a pristine blanket of snow. Namami collapsed, her eyes human again but vacant. Allahrakha was gone, his footprints ending abruptly at the shrine’s entrance.

Felix stared at Vergil. “What the hell are you?”

Vergil ignored him, sheathing the blade. It shrunk into a pendant, cold against his chest. Dadi’s phone, now inert, lay in pieces at his feet.

Gatekeeper’s heir. The words clawed at him. He’d inherited more than a sword—he’d inherited a war.

As they retreated from the valley, Vergil glanced back. High above, the Black Moon lingered, an unblinking eye.
