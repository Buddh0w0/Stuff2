**Chapter 4: Shadows in Sunlight**

Vergil hesitated outside the school gates, watching Namami through the frost-tinted window. She sat alone, her phone dark for once, staring at the wall with an intensity that made her pupils flicker—a flash of silver, there and gone. Allahrakha slid up beside him, hands in his pockets.

“She’s been… off, hasn’t she?” he said, voice uncharacteristically soft. “Ever since I tried to invite her to study group. She nearly threw a chair at me.”

Vergil frowned. “Since when do you care?”

Allahrakha shrugged. “Just saying. Maybe that fever messed with more than your sleep.”

That night, Vergil dreamt of the blizzard again. This time, Namami stood at the valley’s edge, her small frame haloed by the storm. She turned, eyes bleeding silver. “You shouldn’t have come back.”

**Chapter 5: The Uninvited Guest**

The trip to Salva Hills began with tension. Namami arrived first, her usual oversized hoodie replaced by a sleek black coat. She didn’t speak, didn’t glance at her phone. When Felix joked about her “makeover,” she slammed her fist into the van’s window, cracking the glass.

“Whoa, easy!” Allahrakha raised his hands, stepping between them. “We’re all friends here, right?”

Namami’s gaze snapped to Vergil. “He isn’t your friend,” she hissed.

The cabin was worse. Namami claimed the attic, dragging her luggage—a heavy, ancient-looking trunk—up the stairs. That night, Vergil found her in the kitchen, carving symbols into the table with a steak knife.

“What are you doing?” he demanded.

She smiled. “Preparing.”

**Chapter 6: The First Blood**

They awoke to screams. Felix’s arm was slashed, blood streaking the hallway. He pointed a shaking finger at Namami’s door. “She—she came at me! Said I ‘wasn’t part of the ritual!’”

Allahrakha bandaged the wound, his hands steady. “We need to leave. Now.”

But the roads were buried. Snow piled against the doors like a tomb.

Namami descended the stairs at dawn, her hair braided with black cords that dripped ice. “Too late,” she said. “The Moon is rising.”

Vergil’s phone buzzed. A message from Dadi’s number:

Unknown Sender: She’s not Namami.

**Chapter 7: The Silver-Eyed Puppet**

They cornered her in the attic. The trunk lay open, filled with bone-white candles and a dagger etched with runes. Namami knelt, chanting as the storm outside howled her name.

“Stop this!” Allahrakha shouted. “Whatever they promised you—it’s a lie!”

She laughed, the sound jagged. “They didn’t promise anything. I called them.”

The windows shattered. Cold poured in, coalescing into a figure with claws of frost. Namami rose, silver eyes blazing. “The Black Moon demands a sacrifice. One of you will do.”

Allahrakha stepped forward, voice pleading. “Namami, please—this isn’t you!”

Vergil lunged for the dagger, but Namami was faster. She slashed his palm, smearing blood on the entity’s claw. “Him,” she said. “The Dreamer dies first.”

**Chapter 8: The Innocent Bystander**

Chaos erupted. Felix tackled Namami, pinning her as Allahrakha dragged Vergil back. The entity lunged, but Allahrakha threw himself in its path, taking the brunt of the blow. He crumpled, blood pooling beneath him.

“Run!” he gasped. “Get to the valley—the shrine—”

Namami writhed free, snarling. “You pathetic fool! You think kindness saves anyone?” She raised the dagger, but Vergil tackled her, sending it skidding across the floor.

The entity seized Namami instead, its claws piercing her shoulders. She screamed—a human sound, raw and terrified—before the storm swallowed her whole.

**Chapter 9: The Bitter Truth**

In the shrine, Vergil found the blade. Its hilt fit his grip like a memory. Dadi’s phone buzzed one last time, a voice breaking through static:

“The entity needed a vessel. It chose her… but the boy fought it.”

Allahrakha staggered in, clutching his side. “Namami… she let it in. Weeks ago. I tried to stop her, but—”

Felix glared. “Why didn’t you say something?!”

“Would you have believed me?”

Vergil tightened his grip on the blade. Outside, the Black Moon hung low, its light staining the snow. Namami’s silver eyes flickered in the shadows, her laughter echoing.

**Chapter 10: The Glowing Blade**

The shrine’s walls trembled as Vergil gripped the sword, its edge humming with spectral energy. Outside, the Black Moon’s light pierced the blizzard, staining the sky in bruise-like hues of blue and black. Namami stood at the valley’s heart, her silhouette warped by the storm. Silver veins pulsed beneath her skin, and her once-fair face was streaked with dried blood.

“You’re too late, Vergil,” she said, her voice layered with a guttural growl. “The Moon is here. He is here.”

The entity’s presence thickened the air, but Vergil stepped forward, the blade’s glow intensifying. “I’m taking you home, Namami.”

She laughed—a sound that cracked into something inhuman. “Home? I am home.”

Then it began.

**Chapter 11: The Nemesis Revealed**

On the tip of the glowing blade, a drop of blood sizzles and burns.

Vergil’s first strike grazed her arm. Namami’s blood hissed as it met the sword’s edge, evaporating into black smoke. She staggered back, her silver eyes widening in rage.

The blue and black clouds swirl in an ominous spiral.

The sky churned, the Black Moon’s gravity warping the storm into a vortex. Ice and debris lifted around them, forming a cage of howling wind.

The wind from the heavens blows the dust beneath his feet, as Vergil raises his sword towards his nemesis.

He lunged again, but Namami parried with a blade of her own—a jagged shard of ice summoned from the storm. Their weapons clashed, sparks of blue and black light erupting with each collision.

She expresses an amused grin, as blood trickles down her visage.

“You’re weak,” she spat, her grin sharp and mocking. Blood seeped from a cut on her cheekbone, but she didn’t flinch. “You still think this is a rescue? I chose this power. I chose Him!”

**Chapter 12: The Cost of Truth**

Allahrakha’s voice cut through the chaos. “The blade, Vergil! Strike the Moon’s reflection!”

Vergil glanced at the ice beneath his feet. The Black Moon’s inverted image shimmered in the frozen ground—a perfect, dark mirror.

Namami roared, charging with her icy weapon. Vergil sidestepped, driving his sword into the reflection. The ground shattered.

Light erupted—a searing white beam that tore through the storm. The entity’s scream echoed as the Black Moon fractured, its shards dissolving into ash. Namami collapsed, the silver draining from her eyes.

When the light faded, the valley was silent. The blizzard had stopped.

**Chapter 13: After the Storm**

Namami lay unconscious but breathing, her skin pale but human. Allahrakha knelt beside her, his hands trembling. “It’s over. The bond is broken.”

Vergil stared at the sword, now dull and lifeless. “What was she?”

“A vessel,” Allahrakha murmured. “The entity preyed on her loneliness. Made her believe she was in control… until she wasn’t.”

Felix limped over, clutching his injured arm. “And you knew this whole time?”

“I tried to stop her. But the Black Moon… it warps minds. Even mine.”

Vergil sheathed the blade, its weight a new burden. The first paragraph of his story—the clash under the spiraling sky—had been a premonition. A warning.

And he’d survived it.

But as they trudged back to the cabin, Vergil glanced at the horizon. The Moon was gone, but the sky still held a faint stain—a shadow where it had been.

**Chapter 14: The Weight of Shadows**

The return to school felt like stepping into a sepia photograph—dull and lifeless. Rumors about the "accident" at Salva Hills buzzed through the halls, painting Vergil as either a hero or a lunatic. Namami’s desk sat empty, her absence a void even her classmates avoided acknowledging.

Ichiyoru greeted Vergil at his apartment door, her fur bristling as she stared at the stain in the sky—a smudge of ink on glass, visible only to those who knew to look. Vergil traced the blade pendant at his chest, now cold and dormant.

Dadi’s phone, cracked but functional, buzzed on his nightstand. A garbled voice message played: "...the Gatekeeper’s blood... binds the seal..."

**Chapter 15: The Cryptic Heirloom**

Allahrakha cornered Vergil after class, his usual charm replaced by a grim urgency. "You need to see this."

In his backpack, he carried an ancient ledger filled with symbols matching those on Vergil’s blade. "My great-grandfather wrote this. He called the Black Moon ‘The Eye That Hungers.’ Your family didn’t just guard the blade—they fed it."

Vergil recoiled. "Fed it what?"

"Blood," Allahrakha said flatly. "The Gatekeeper’s line seals the Moon by sacrifice. Your dreams? They’re not warnings. They’re memories."

**Chapter 16: Fractured Reflections**

Namami awoke in a hospital bed, her wrists bandaged where the entity’s claws had pierced. Vergil found her sketching the valley in frantic strokes, the paper torn by her pencil.

"Its voice... it’s still there," she whispered. "Like static. It says the Moon isn’t dead—it’s waiting."

She pressed a crumpled note into his hand—coordinates scrawled in ice-blue ink. "Where it began. Where it’ll end."

The location matched a symbol in Dadi’s phone: Black Moon Shrine, 1912.

**Chapter 17: The Stain Spreads**

Felix hacked into the school’s archives, unearthing news clippings about a blizzard that buried Salva Hills a century ago. "Every 108 years," he muttered. "The Moon returns. And guess what year it is now?"

Outside, the stain in the sky pulsed, stretching tendrils toward the town. Birds fell silent. Streetlights flickered. Ichiyoru yowled, her eyes reflecting twin crescents.

Vergil’s nightmares returned—not of snow, but of a cathedral-like structure beneath the valley, its altars stained with old blood.

**Chapter 18: The Gathering Storm**

The group reconvened in Vergil’s apartment, tensions taut.

"You expect us to go back there?" Felix snapped.

"Namami’s coordinates lead underground," Vergil said, projecting Dadi’s map. "The original shrine. If the Moon feeds on sacrifice, we destroy its source."

Allahrakha hesitated. "My family’s ledger mentions a ‘Keybearer’—someone who can sever the bond. But it requires a price."

"What price?"

"Something alive," he said, avoiding Vergil’s gaze.

Ichiyoru leapt onto the table, her tail lashing. The pendant at Vergil’s neck flared—a warning.

**Chapter 19: The Edge of Truth**

The descent into the valley’s underbelly was a crawl through ice and bone. The shrine’s true form loomed—a cathedral carved from glacial rock, its walls etched with faces frozen in agony.

At its center stood an altar, the blade’s twin embedded in stone. Vergil reached for it, but the pendant seared his skin. Dadi’s voice echoed: "Blood binds. Blood breaks."

Namami staggered, clutching her temples. "It’s here. It’s awake."

The air split. The entity materialized, its form more solid, more human—a mirror of Vergil’s face twisted into a sneer.

"Welcome home, Heir," it hissed. "You’ve brought my offering."

Allahrakha stepped forward, a dagger glinting in his hand.
