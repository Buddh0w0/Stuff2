**Chapter 4: The Unseen Compulsion**

Vergil stared at his phone, the words "Sweet dreams" lingering like a threat. He tossed the device onto his bed, where Ichiyoru pawed at it curiously. "Salva Hills…" The name alone made his skin prickle. But Namami’s involvement gnawed at him. Since when did she agree to anything beyond her phone screen?

He opened his closet, eyeing the old hiking backpack buried under winter coats. Dadi’s phone, still lifeless, sat on his desk. On impulse, he slipped it into the bag. Maybe the cold will jolt it awake, he thought bitterly.

Ichiyoru mewed, her golden eyes reflecting the dim balcony light. Vergil scooped her up, pressing his forehead to hers. "Stay out of trouble," he murmured. The cat blinked slowly, as if in warning.

**Chapter 5: The Road to Salva Hills**

Christmas Eve dawned brittle and gray. Vergil stood at the bus stop, hoodie pulled tight against the wind. Allahrakha’s van rolled up, its windows fogged with condensation. Inside, Namami sat hunched in the backseat, her face lit by her phone’s glow. Felix lounged beside her, smirking.

"Took you long enough," Felix said, tossing Vergil a thermos. "Hot chocolate. Wouldn’t want you freezing before we get there."

Vergil ignored him, sliding into the passenger seat. Allahrakha grinned, his teeth too white. "Glad you made it, bro. You’re gonna love this."

The drive twisted through skeletal forests, the sky darkening prematurely. Vergil’s fingers brushed Dadi’s phone in his pocket. It felt… warmer.

**Chapter 6: The First Night**

Salva Hills was a ghost town swallowed by snowdrifts. The group rented a cabin on the outskirts, its wooden beams creaking under the weight of winter. Vergil’s nightmares seeped into reality: the same blinding blizzard, the same howling wind.

At midnight, Namami vanished.

They found her standing barefoot in the snow, halfway up the hill behind the cabin. Her breath fogged the air as she murmured, "He’s waiting."

"Who’s waiting?" Felix demanded, but Allahrakha silenced him with a raised hand.

"Let her go," he said, his voice unnervingly calm. "She’s just… connecting."

Vergil’s phone buzzed. A notification from Dadi’s number—impossible, it hadn’t worked in years. The screen flickered:

12:07 AM
Unknown Sender: Turn back.

**Chapter 7: The Black Moon Rises**

The storm hit at dawn. Snow piled against the cabin doors, sealing them inside. Felix paced, ranting about "wasted time," while Allahrakha sketched symbols on the frost-edged windows. Namami sat motionless, her phone dark for the first time.

Vergil retreated to the attic, Dadi’s phone glowing faintly in his palm. Static hissed from its speaker, resolving into a voice—his voice, warped and desperate: "The blade… find the blade."

Below, a scream tore through the silence.

Felix stood in the living room, pointing at the fireplace. The flames burned black, and within them, a silhouette emerged—tall, clawed, its eyes twin voids. Allahrakha laughed, low and guttural. "Right on time."

Namami rose, her pupils swallowed by silver. "The Black Moon hungers," she intoned. "He comes for the dreamer."

Vergil’s backpack vibrated. He unzipped it, and the old phone’s screen blazed to life, projecting a map into the air—a pulsing red dot deep in the valley. The same valley from his dreams.

Outside, the blizzard parted. A single path cut through the snow, leading into the heart of the storm.
