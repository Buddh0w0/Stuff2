On the tip of the glowing blade, a drop of blood sizzles and burns. The blue and black clouds swirl in an ominous spiral. The wind from the heavens blows the dust beneath his feet, as Vergil raises his sword towards his nemesis. She expresses an amused grin, as blood trickles down her visage. 

Vergil suddenly opens his eyes. The blur in his vision clears as he looks around his room, now flooded in broad sunlight. He looks at the clock on his bedside table. "Hell nah, I'm late", says he, as a shiny mass of darkness jumps up onto his lap. He pets her on her head as she purrs gently. "Alright Ichiyoru, I'm getting late for school. We can cuddle when I get back."
